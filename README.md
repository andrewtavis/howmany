## Wikidata powered comparisons

**howmany** is a Python package that uses [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) entity properties to easily compare the dimensions of any object. The package leverages the [Wikidata REST API](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:REST_API) to easily derive amount values and then compare them given unit ratios.

You can use howmany to find the answers to questions including:

- How many association football pitches would fit inside Germany?
- How many Germanys would fit inside an association football pitch?
- And eventually anything else that [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) has dimensions for!

# Installation [`â‡§`](#contents)

howmany can be downloaded from PyPI via pip or sourced directly from this repository:

```bash
pip install howmany
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewtavis/howmany.git
cd howmany
python setup.py install
```

```python
import howmany
```

# Environment Setup [`â‡§`](#contents)

The development environment for howmany can be installed via the following steps:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [howmany repo](https://github.com/andrewtavis/howmany), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/howmany.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) ðŸ”‘

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/howmany.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd howmany
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/andrewtavis/howmany.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (howmany repository)

2. Use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create the local development environment within your howmany directory:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

<a id="examples"></a>

# Examples [`â‡§`](#contents)

See the [examples directory](https://github.com/andrewtavis/howmany/tree/main/examples) for example Jupyter notebooks.

A basic howmany workflow is:

```py
import howmany
from howmany.utils import float_to_str

soccer_fields_in_germany_dict = howmany.compare(
    containers="Q183", entities="Q8524", pid="P2046", iso="en"
)

for k in soccer_fields_in_germany_dict.keys():
    amount = round(soccer_fields_in_germany_dict[k]["amount"], 2)
    print(
        f"You could fit {amount:,} {soccer_fields_in_germany_dict[k]['entity']}es inside {k}."
    )

# You could fit 50,453,300.88 association football pitches inside Germany.

germanies_in_soccer_fields_dict = howmany.compare(
    containers="Q8524", entities="Q183", pid="P2046", iso="en"
)

for k in germanies_in_soccer_fields_dict.keys():
    amount = float_to_str(germanies_in_soccer_fields_dict[k]["amount"])
    print(
        f"You could fit {amount} {germanies_in_soccer_fields_dict[k]['entity']}s inside an {k}."
    )

# You could fit 0.000000019820308731475912 Germanys inside an association football pitch.
```
