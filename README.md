## Wikidata powered comparisons

**howmany** is a Python package that uses [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) entity properties to easily compare the dimensions of any object. You can use it to find the answers to questions including:

<!-- - How many olympic swimming pools worth of water would fit in the Pacific Ocean?
- How many Eiffel Towers could you stack between the Earth to the Moon? -->

- How many association football pitches would fit inside Germany?
- And eventually anything else that [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) has dimensions for!

# Installation [`â‡§`](#contents)

howmany can be downloaded from PyPI via pip or sourced directly from this repository:

```bash
pip install howmany
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewtavis/howmany.git
cd howmany
python setup.py install
```

```python
import howmany
```

# Environment Setup [`â‡§`](#contents)

The development environment for howmany can be installed via the following steps:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [howmany repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/howmany), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]

> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/howmany.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) ðŸ”‘

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/howmany.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd howmany
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scibe-Data.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (howmany repository)

2. Use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create the local development environment within your howmany directory:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

# Examples [`â‡§`](#contents)

As of now howmany does one thing:

```bash
python src/howmany/in.py
# You could fit 50,453,300.88 association football pitches inside Germany.
```
